# System Architecture

This document provides an overview of the TE-KOA system architecture, explaining the key components and how they interact.

## High-Level Architecture

The TE-KOA project is structured as a Python package with several modules that handle different aspects of the application:

```
tekoa/
├── io/                   # Input/output operations
├── configuration/       # Configuration settings
├── utils/                # Utility functions
└── visualization/        # Data visualization components
```

## Component Overview

### Data Loading and Processing

The data loading and processing components are responsible for:

- Loading data from Excel files (either uploaded through the UI or from a directory)
- Preprocessing the data
- Handling missing values
- Analyzing data quality

Key classes and modules:

- `DataLoader` in `tekoa/io/data_loader.py`: Handles loading and preprocessing data
- `analyze_dictionary.py` in `tekoa/io/`: Analyzes the data dictionary
- `analyze_excel_file.py` in `tekoa/io/`: Analyzes Excel file structure

As noted in the project memory, the `DataLoader` class has been modified to prioritize loading data from an `uploaded_file` object if provided during initialization.

### Configuration Management

The configuration management components handle:

- Application settings
- Parameter definitions
- Environment variables

Key modules:

- `settings.py` in `tekoa/configuration/`: Defines application settings
- `params.py` in `tekoa/configuration/`: Defines parameter values

### Visualization

The visualization components provide:

- Interactive dashboard using Streamlit
- Data exploration tools
- Statistical visualizations
- Analysis results presentation

Key modules:

- `app.py` in `tekoa/visualization/`: Main Streamlit application
- `app_refactored_claude_components/` in `tekoa/visualization/`: UI and logic components for the dashboard

### Utilities

The utilities components provide:

- Helper functions
- File monitoring
- Logging

Key modules:

- `watchdog.py` in `tekoa/utils/`: File monitoring utilities

## Data Flow

1. **Data Input**:
   - User uploads an Excel file through the Streamlit interface
   - The file is passed to the `DataLoader` class

2. **Data Processing**:
   - The `DataLoader` loads the data and data dictionary
   - Missing values are identified and can be imputed
   - Data quality is assessed

3. **Analysis**:
   - Various analyses are performed on the data
   - Results are calculated and prepared for visualization

4. **Visualization**:
   - Analysis results are displayed in the Streamlit dashboard
   - Interactive visualizations allow users to explore the data

5. **Export**:
   - Processed data can be exported for further analysis

## Integration Points

### External Libraries

The TE-KOA project integrates with several external libraries:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations
- **Streamlit**: For the interactive dashboard
- **Matplotlib/Plotly**: For data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning and statistical analysis

### File System

The application interacts with the file system for:

- Loading data from Excel files
- Saving processed data
- Reading and writing configuration files

## Deployment Architecture

The TE-KOA application can be deployed in several ways:

### Local Deployment

For local development and testing:

- Python virtual environment
- Local file system for data storage
- Streamlit server running locally

### Docker Deployment

For containerized deployment:

- Docker container with all dependencies
- Volume mounts for data persistence
- Exposed port for accessing the Streamlit interface

### Cloud Deployment

For production deployment:

- Streamlit Cloud for hosting the dashboard
- Cloud storage for data (if needed)
- Environment variables for configuration

## Security Considerations

- The application does not store sensitive patient data
- Data is processed in memory and not persisted unless explicitly exported
- No authentication is currently implemented (consider adding if sensitive data will be used)

## Future Architecture Extensions

Potential future extensions to the architecture include:

- Database integration for persistent storage
- Authentication and authorization for multi-user access
- API endpoints for programmatic access
- Integration with other data sources and formats
